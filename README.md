Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam) using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains labeled SMS messages, and the model is trained to differentiate between spam and non-spam messages using text-based features.

üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which consists of:

Ham (legitimate) messages

Spam messages (unsolicited or fraudulent messages)

Each message is labeled accordingly to train the model.

üöÄ Technologies Used

Python

Scikit-Learn

Pandas

NumPy

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

Matplotlib & Seaborn

üèóÔ∏è Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing

Load the dataset

Clean and preprocess text data (removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.)

Convert text data into numerical format using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing message distribution

Word cloud representation of spam vs. ham messages

Model Selection & Training

Train models like Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest

Compare performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Evaluation & Results

Evaluate model on test data

Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve performance

Deployment (Optional)

Deploy model using Flask or FastAPI

Create a web app for real-time SMS classification

üî¨ Performance Metrics

Accuracy: Measures overall correctness

Precision: Measures correctness of spam predictions

Recall: Measures how many actual spam messages were detected

F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

Future Improvements

Improve text preprocessing with advanced NLP techniques

Train with deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers)

Deploy as an API for real-world usage
